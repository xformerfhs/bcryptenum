# Bcryptenum

[![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/xformerfhs/bcryptenum)](https://github.com/xformerfhs/bcryptenum/blob/main/LICENSE)

This is a small C program that enumerates all [`BCrypt`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/seccng/cng-portal) (aka Cryptography API: Next Generation (`CNG`) algorithms on Windows and prints them on the console.

It is useful when one wants to use a `BCrypt` algorithm and needs to know which algorithms are supported on a machine, as this depends on the Windows version.
E.g. the [SHA-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) hash functions are supported since Windows 11 24H2 (Version 10.0.26100.2161), 9 years after the NIST published the [SHA-3 standard](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/FIPS/NIST.FIPS.202.pdf)!

This program needs the Windows SDK V10.0.28000.1839 or newer.

Since [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/) – for some reason that completely eludes me – uses the cryptographic functions of the platform OS the list of supported algorithms is relevant for .NET, as well.

This program does not use the C runtime.
Only bcrypt.dll, kernel32.dll and version.dll are needed.
